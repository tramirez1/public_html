        I chose <a href="https://www.babson.edu">Babson</a> because I think entrepreneurhsip is a developing 
        skill in the business world especially with millenials. Companies and people are starting to think how 
        to for example work from home and implement a more individualistic approach. Furthermore, more and more 
        millenials each year wanr to work alone, without having a boss, hence the reason for thinking and learning entrepreneurially. 
        After I graduate I want to work at Fidelity Investments. The reason for this is because Fidelity is approaching the individual
        work, like working from home and using offices for more than one person. I think that it is the future.

    <p>
        My favorite sport and interest is  <a href="https://www.usta.org">Tennis</a>. I have played it since I was a 
        little girl and followed all the tournaments. When I was in high school I was part of the tennis 
        team and apart from that I trained around six hours a day. Then in the weekends I went to tournament 
        all over the nation and finally got into Babson and played for the tennis team. The reason it is my 
        favorite sport is because it not only helped me grow as a person, but also helped me be disciplined, 
        learn to control my mind, and work individually and as a team.
